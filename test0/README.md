## Convolution kernels test
Example if an implemetation of convolution kernels for image filters. The filters assume the image will be padded by half the width of the kernel size and normalized to [0, 1] 32 bit float.

## To-Do:
- [x] Breakdown main to several files

- [ ] Add more convolution filters

- [x] Make header files work

- [ ] wrap most preprocessing filters from openPIV/preprocessing
